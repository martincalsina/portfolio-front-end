# Repository for my portfolio Front end

## Linked to the deployed version

https://portfolio-9c331.web.app

Be aware that it may take up to a five minutes to process the first request (probably'll be getting the user data) to the API since I it is using a free tier of Render for the backend.

## Description

As I needed a way to present myself to the IT world, and my previous and older portfolio API stopped working, I decided to built a new one from zero, implementing better practices than before and also making it capable of support multiple users profiles, letting it be a service provider.

## Used Technologies

- Angular 17.0.6
- Rxjs 7.8.1
- Bootstrap 5.3.2
- Fontawesome 4.7.0
- Typescript 5.2.2

## Features and Principal functionalities

The project allows user to create their own portfolio by signing up in a page dedicated to it and then logging into their accounts. There, they will be able to set a profile pic, their names, a quick aboutme description, a headline and a list of what one could expect in the corresponding education, experience, skills, projects and network sections. For each of them, the CRUD opperations are support.
